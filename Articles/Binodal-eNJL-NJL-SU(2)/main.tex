\section{Introduction}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The complete understanding of the quantum chromodynamics (QCD) phase diagram represents a challenge in both theoretical and experimental physics. While many of the features it aims to describe can be tested in earth experiments, other aspects related to matter under extreme conditions, can only be infered from lattice QCD (LQCD) \cite{lqcd} or from observational results of astrophysical objects.

From the experimental point of view, the Beam Energy Scan (BES-I,
BES-II) programs at RHIC have provided 
data on signatures of a first order phase transition and
the possible existence and location of the critical end point (CEP)
\cite{BES}, which would indicate the end of the first order phase
transition and the beginning of a cross over. Future
experiments to take place at the FAIR facility at GSI \cite{FAIR} ,
NICA at the JINR \cite{NICA} and the NA61/SHINE program at SPS (CERN)
\cite{NA61} will also contribute to shed some light into these still unknwon aspects.

From the LQCD side, the transition is believed to be a cross over,
reforcing the idea of the existence of a critical end point. However,
due to some numerical difficulties as the {\it sign problem} and the
need of expensive computational facilities, the whole diagram is not
expected to be covered in a near future, and so far, only the region close to
zero chemical potential has been assessed.

The improvement of the observational results of compact objects are also expected soon from the future x-ray telescopes, such as NICER \cite{NICER} and Athena \cite{ATHENA}, contributing to the understanding of the low temperature-high density region of the phase diagram.

Meanwhile, effective models remain a good source of information
through qualitative results and the present work helps in advancing
our knowledge towards some of the regions of the QCD phase diagram. 
It is worth mentioning that at low temperatures the phase transition can take place at two steps by first restoring the chiral transition where matter is still confined giving rise to a phase known as quarkyonic \cite{quarkyonic}, and only later on, suffering the transition to the deconfined phase. 

We focus our work on two major points: the investigation of the phase transition from hadronic matter to quark matter at zero temperature and the possibility that this transtion is correlated with a conversion from a mestastable hadronic to a stable quark star.

Considerations on the phase transition at zero temperature have
already been done in many works \cite{Cavagnoli2011, Tsue2010,
  Lee2013}, but we do believe the formalism we present next is more
adequate. If the appearance of a quarkyonic phase is taken seriously,
the model to be used should consider chiral symmetry in both hadronic
and quark phases and a model that naturally exhibits chiral effects is
the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model \cite{NJL}.

 In \cite{Cavagnoli2011}, the phase transition was
investigated with the help of two different models, namely, the
non-linear Walecka model (NLWM) for the hadronic phase and the MIT bag
model for the quark phase. A formalism more similar with what we apply
next was used at zero \cite{Tsue2010} and finite \cite{Lee2013}
temperature, where the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio type models were used for
both phases. To describe the hadron phase, the standard NJL model with
vector interaction is extended to include a scalar-vector channel,
which renders the model capable of saturation at low densities \cite{Koch1987}.
In the present work, we revisit the approach of~\cite{Tsue2010}
and~\cite{Lee2013}, but the extended model we use for the hadron 
phase~\cite{Pais2016} includes  additional channels so that a better 
description of important nuclear bulk properties is achieved.
Albeit the authors also refer to this extension as eNJL, here we will
name the more complete extension PPM NJL, to avoid confusion with the
version first proposed in \cite{Koch1987}.

Hence, we obtain hadronic matter with the PPM NJL model and the quark
matter with the NJL in its SU(2) version and check for which
parameters of these two models, the phase transition is possible. In
the sequel, we implement equations of state (EoS) for both phases to
descrive respectively hadronic and quark stars (within the SU(3)
version of the NJL model) and once again, check
when the star is metastable and if a possible conversion can give rise
to energies compatible with $\gamma$-ray bursts 
\cite{2002NuPhS.113..268B, 2003ApJ...586.1250B, 2004ApJ...614..314B,
  burst}. We then compare both results.


This work is organised as follows: in Section II we describe the basic
formulae necessary to the understanding of the formalism uderlying the
NJL model in all versions we need. In Section III we discuss how to
obtain the binodal points at zero temperature, display and comment our
results. In Section IV, we investigate the existence of metastable
neutron stars and the possible conversion to stable quark
stars. Finally, in the last section, we make some final remarks and
discuss the continuation of the present work.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Formalism} 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

In the following we present the basic equations underlying the NJL
models in three different versions: the usual SU(2) and SU(3) versions
that describe quark matter and the PPM version of the NJL model that
describes hadronic matter. 

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Quark Matter - NJL SU(2)}\label{NJLSU2}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


The quark phase is described by a SU(2) NJL model lagrangian, including a vector term, given by \cite{Buballa2005}
\begin{equation}\label{Eq:LagNJL-SU2-Bub}
\begin{split}
	\mathscr{L} =&~ \bar{\psi}(i\gamma^\mu\partial_\mu - m_0)\psi \\
	&+ G_s[(\bar{\psi}\psi)^2 + (\bar{\psi}i\gamma_5\vec{\tau}\psi)^2] - G_v(\bar{\psi}\gamma^\mu \psi)^2.
\end{split}
\end{equation}
%
Here $\psi$ represents the quark field, $m_0$ the quark bare mass, and
$G_s$ and $G_v$ are coupling constants that are chosen by fitting the
pion mass $m_\pi = 135.0~\rm{MeV}$ and its decay constant $f_\pi =
92.4~\rm{MeV}$. As the theory is non-renormalizable, a momentum cutoff
$\Lambda$ is employed, which acts as a new parameter.
In Table \ref{Tab:Parametros_NJL}, four possible parameter sets usually
considered in the literature are given. Notice that the $G_v$
parameter can be arbitrarily chosen.

From the lagrangian $\mathscr{L}$, the hamiltonian density $\mathscr{H}$ can be obtained, which leads to the thermodynamic potential per volume $V$ at temperature $T$ by means of
\begin{equation}
	\omega(T, \mu) = -\frac{T}{V} \ln \tr \exp\left(-\frac{1}{T}\int d^3x(\mathscr{H} - \mu\psi^\dagger\psi\right),
\end{equation}
%
where $\tr$ stands for a trace over all states of the system, resulting in \cite{Buballa1996}
\begin{equation}\label{Eq:Pot_Termo_Temp_zero}
\begin{split}
	\omega(\mu; m, \mu_R) =&~ \omega_m^{(\rm{vac})} + \omega_m^{(\rm{med})}(\mu_R) \\
	&+ \frac{(m - m_0)^2}{4G_s} - \frac{(\mu - \mu_R)^2}{4G_v} +  \textrm{const.},
\end{split}
\end{equation}
%
with
\begin{align}
	\omega_m^{(\rm{vac})} &= -(2 n_f n_c) \int \frac{d^3p}{(2\pi)^3} E_p\\
	\omega_m^{(\rm{med})}(\mu_R) &= - (2n_f n_c) \int\frac{d^3p}{(2 \pi)^3} (\mu_R - E_p) \theta(p_F -p),
\end{align}
%
at the zero temperature limit in the mean-field approximation. Here $n_f$ and $n_c$ stand for the number of flavors and the number of colors, respectively, and $E_p = \sqrt{p^2 + m^2}$. The Fermi momentum of the quarks is represented by $p_F$ and $\theta(p_F - p)$ stands for the step function.

The renormalized chemical potential $\mu_R$ and the constituent mass $m$ are obtained by requiring that $\partial \omega / \partial \mu_R = 0$ and $\partial \omega / \partial m = 0$, respectively, resulting in
\begin{align}
	\mu_R &= \mu - 2 G_v \rho \\
	m &= m_0 - 2 G_s \rho_s
\end{align}
%
with
\begin{align}
	\rho &= n_c \rho_B = \frac{n_f n_c}{3\pi^2} p_F^3 \\
	\rho_s &= \langle \bar\psi\psi\rangle = - 2 n_f n_c \int\frac{d^3p}{(2\pi)^3} \frac{m}{E_p}(1 - \theta(p_F - p)) \\
	\mu_R &= \sqrt{p_F^2 + m^2},
\end{align}
%
where $\rho_B$ stands for the barionic density.

The constant in the potential has no physical meaning, consequently, it may be chosen so that at $T = \mu = 0$ the thermodynamic potential is zero at the value $m = m_{\rm{vac}}$ which minimizes $\omega$. This process may be represented by 
\begin{equation}
	\tilde\omega(\mu; m, \mu_R) = \omega(\mu; m, \mu_R) - \omega(0, 0; m_{\rm{vac}}, 0),
\end{equation}
%
so that the quantities we are interested in --~the pressure $P$ and the energy density $\varepsilon$~-- are obtained through
\begin{align}
		P &= -\tilde\omega(\mu; m, \mu_R) \label{Exp_pressao_T}\\
		\varepsilon &= -p + \mu \rho. \label{Exp_energia_T}
\end{align}
	
The equations are solved self-consistently for each value of $\rho$ or $\mu$ (in this case $p_F = \sqrt{\mu_R^2 - m^2}\theta(\mu_R^2 - m^2)$).

\subsection{Quark Matter - NJL SU(3)}\label{NJLSU3}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Dense matter in a quark phase can also be described with the
SU(3) version of Nambu Jona Lasinio model, which incorporates the
$s$-quark and the repulsive vector interaction. In this case,
the Lagrangian density is given by
\begin{equation}
\mathscr{L}=\overline{\psi}[\gamma_\mu(i\partial^\mu)-\widehat{m}_f]\psi+
\mathscr{L}_{sym}+\mathscr{L}_{det}+\mathscr{L}_{vec},
\end{equation}
with $\mathscr{L}_{sym}$, $\mathscr{L}_{det}$ and $\mathscr{L}_{vec}$ given by
\begin{eqnarray}
\mathscr{L}_{sym}&=&G_s\sum_{a=0}^8[(\overline{\psi}\lambda_a\psi)^2+(\overline{\psi}i\gamma_5\lambda_a\psi)^2],\nonumber\\
\mathscr{L}_{det}&=&-K\{\mbox{det}[\overline{\psi}(1+\gamma_5)\psi]+\mbox{det}[\overline{\psi}(1-\gamma_5)\psi]\},\nonumber\\
%\mathscr{L}_{vec}&=&-G_s\sum_{a=0}^8[(\overline{\psi}\gamma_\mu\lambda_a\psi)^2+(\overline{\psi}\gamma_5\gamma_\mu\lambda_a\psi)^2],
\mathscr{L}_{vec}&=&-G_s(\overline{\psi}\gamma^\mu\psi)^2,\nonumber
\end{eqnarray}
where $\psi(u,d,s)$ represents a quark field with three flavors,
$\widehat{m}_f=\mbox{diag}(m_u,m_d,m_s)$ is the quark current mass,
$\lambda_0=\sqrt{2/3}I$ where $I$ is the unit matrix in three flavor space,
$\lambda_a(0\leq a \leq 8)$ are the U(3) flavor matrices. 
To obtain effective quark masses $M_i$ we must minimizing thermodynamical potential 
given by $\omega=-P=\varepsilon-\sum_{i=u,d,s}\mu_i\rho_i$, where $\varepsilon$ is the energy
density given by
\begin{eqnarray}
\varepsilon&=&-2N_c\sum_{i=u,d,s}\int\frac{d^3p}{(2\pi)^3}\frac{p^2+m_iM_i}{E_i}\theta(\Lambda^2-p_{Fi}^2)\nonumber\\
&-&2G_s\sum_{i=u,d,s}\langle\overline{q}_iq_i\rangle^2-2K\langle\overline{u}u\rangle\langle\overline{d}d\rangle\langle\overline{s}s\rangle\\
&+&2G_v\rho^2,\nonumber
\end{eqnarray}
where $N_c=3$, $E_i=\sqrt{p_i^2+M_i^2}$, $p_{Fi}=\sqrt{\widetilde{\mu}_i^2-M_i^2}$ and $\rho=\rho_u+\rho_d+\rho_s$.
The renormalized chemical potential $\widetilde{\mu}_i$ is given by
\begin{equation}
\widetilde{\mu}_i=\mu_i-2G_v\rho_i,
\end{equation}
where $i$ refers to the flavor and $\rho_i$ refers to the respective quark number densities. Thus,
minimizing $\omega$, we obtain in mean-field approach the following gap equations
\begin{equation}
M_i=m_i-4G_s\phi_i+2K\phi_j\phi_k,
\end{equation}
with $(i,j,k)$ being any permutation of $(u,d,s)$ and $\phi_i$ 
stands for the scalar condensate of the $i$-flavor quark.
The parameter set used to evaluate the equation of state in this paper
for the NJL SU(3) model is given by 
$\Lambda=631.4$ MeV, $G_s\Lambda^2=1.835$, $K\Lambda^5=9.29$, $m_{u,d}=5.5$ MeV, $m_s=135.7$ MeV
and $G_v=xG_s$, where $x$ is again an arbitrary and free parameter
which we vary  such that $0<x<1$, according to Ref. \cite{PhysRevD.64.043005} 

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Hadron Matter - PPM NJL}\label{NJLHM} 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Even though the original NJL model is unable to describe the
saturation properties of the nuclear matter, this can be fixed by an
extended version which includes a scalar-vector channel
(eNJL)~\cite{Koch1987}. Other channels that can help the description
of other important bulk properties, as discussed next and are also
included in the lagrangian density of the PPM model ~\cite{Pais2016}:

\begin{equation}\label{Eq:Lagrangiana_eNLJ_Pais}
\begin{split}
	\mathscr{L} =&~ \bar{\psi}(i\gamma^\mu\partial_\mu - m_0)\psi \\
	& + G_s[(\bar{\psi}\psi)^2 + (\bar{\psi}i\gamma_5\vec{\tau}\psi)^2] \\
	& - G_v(\bar{\psi}\gamma^\mu\psi)^2 - G_{sv}[(\bar{\psi}\psi)^2 + (\bar{\psi}i\gamma_5\vec{\tau}\psi)^2](\bar{\psi}\gamma^\mu\psi)^2 \\
	& - G_\rho[(\bar{\psi}\gamma^\mu\vec{\tau}\psi)^2 + (\bar{\psi}\gamma_5\gamma^\mu\vec{\tau}\psi)^2] \\
	& - G_{v\rho}(\bar{\psi}\gamma^\mu\psi)^2[(\bar{\psi}\gamma^\mu\vec{\tau}\psi)^2 + (\bar{\psi}\gamma_5\gamma^\mu\vec{\tau}\psi)^2] \\
	& - G_{s\rho} [(\bar{\psi}\psi)^2 + (\bar{\psi}i\gamma_5\vec{\tau}\psi)^2][(\bar{\psi}\gamma^\mu\vec{\tau}\psi)^2 + (\bar{\psi}\gamma_5\gamma^\mu\vec{\tau}\psi)^2],
\end{split}
\end{equation}
%
where $\psi$ represents the nucleon field and the constants $G_i$
represents the coupling constants for the different channels, whose
effects are: the term in $G_v$ simulates a chiral-invariant
short-range repulsion between the nucleons, the term in $G_{sv}$
accounts for the density dependence of the scalar coupling, the term
in $G_\rho$ allows the description of isospin asymmetric matter, and
the terms in $G_{\omega\rho}$ and $G_{s\rho}$ make the symmetry energy
softer. For nuclear matter, the NJL model leads to binding, but the
binding energy per particle does not have a mininum except at a rather
high density where the nucleon mass is small or vanishing. The
introduction of the term in $G_{sv}$ helps to corrects this unwanted feature.
As in the quark case, the theory is renormalized via a three momentum cutoff
$\Lambda$. In Table \ref {Tab:Parametros_eNJL}, the parameter sets
used in the present work are given.

The thermodynamic potential is obtained from~\eqref{Eq:Lagrangiana_eNLJ_Pais} in the same way as for the quark case and is given by
\begin{equation}\label{Eq:potencial_termodinamico}
\begin{split}
	\omega(\mu) =&~ \varepsilon_{\rm{kin}} + m\rho_s - G_s\rho_s^2 + G_v\rho_B^2 + G_{sv}\rho_s^2\rho_B^2 + G_\rho\rho_3^2 \\
	&+ G_{v\rho}\rho_B^2\rho_3^2 + G_{s\rho}\rho_s^2\rho_3^2 - \mu_p\rho_B^p - \mu_n\rho_B^n,
\end{split}
\end{equation}
%
where $\rho_B$ is the total barionic density, which is the sum of the proton $\rho_B^p$ and neutron $\rho_B^n$ barionic densities, while $\rho_3 = \rho_B^p - \rho_B^n$. At zero temperature, those densities are given by
\begin{equation}
	\rho_B^i = \int_0^{p_F^i}\frac{dp}{\pi^2}p^2; \qquad i = p,n
\end{equation}
%
where $p_F^i$ stands for the Fermi momentum of each particle. The kinectic energy contribution is given by
\begin{equation}
	\varepsilon_{\rm{kin}} = 2 n_c \sum_i \int \frac{d^3p}{(2\pi)^3}\frac{p^2}{E_p^i}(1 - \theta(p_F^i - p))\theta(\Lambda^2 - p^2).
\end{equation}

The effective mass $m$ and the chemical potentials appearing in the thermodynamic potencial $\omega$ are determined by requiring that $\partial\omega/\partial m = 0$ and $\partial\omega/\partial p_F^i = $, resulting in
\begin{align}\label{Eq:Gap}
	m &= m_0 - 2G_s\rho_s + 2G_{sv}\rho_s\rho^2 + 2 G_{s\rho}\rho_s\rho_3^2 ,\\
	\mu_i &= E_{p_F}^i + 2G_v\rho + 2G_{sv}\rho\rho_s^2 \pm 2G_\rho\rho_3+2G_{v\rho}\rho_3^2\rho \nonumber \\
	&\phantom{=} \pm 2G_{v\rho}\rho^2\rho_3 \pm 2 G_{s\rho}\rho_3\rho_s^2,
\end{align}
%
with $i = p,n$, and e $E_{p_F}^i = \sqrt{M^2 + (p_F^i)^2}$. The scalar
density $\rho_s$ is given by the sum of the proton and neutron scalar densities
\begin{equation}
	\rho_s^i = - 2 n_c \int \frac{d^3p}{(2\pi)^3}\frac{m_0^i m_i}{E_p^i}\theta(p_F - p)\theta(\Lambda^2 - p^2),
\end{equation}
%
where $i = p, n$.

The equations of state can be obtained from
\begin{align}
	P &= -\omega(\mu) + \omega_{\rm{vac}} ,\\
	\varepsilon &= -P + \mu_p \rho_B^p + \mu_n \rho_B^n,
\end{align}
%
where $\omega_{\rm{vac}} = \omega(T = 0, \mu = 0, m = m_N)$, with $m_N$ representing the nucleon mass.

\section{Binodals}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Before we start our discussion on the phase transition itself, we display In Fig.\ref{eos}, the EoS of
both phases for two specific choices of parameters. {\bf checar: The
discontinuities are related to the points where chiral symmetry is
restored and the points where the pressure becomes negative are
omitted. In Table \ref{newtable} we show, for each of the quark and
the hadronic model, the density and chemical potential, at which
chiral symmetry is restored.}

The QCD phase-diagram is characterized by potentially multiple phases, whose phase separation boundaries are referred as \emph{binodals} \cite{Mueller1995}. Over those boundaries, the phases from the regions of either side of the boundary can coexist. The binodals may be determined using the Gibbs' conditions \cite{Cavagnoli2011}:
\begin{align}
\mu_B^Q &= \mu_B^H , \\
T^Q &= T^H ,\\
P^Q &= P^H ,
\end{align}
%
where the indexes $H$ and $Q$ refer to the hadronic and quark phases. The chemical potentials are given by
\begin{align}
	\mu_B^H &= \frac{\mu_p + \mu_n}{2} , \\
	\mu_B^Q &= \frac{3}{2} (\mu_u + \mu_d) = 3 \mu_q.
\end{align}
%
At one fixed temperature (in this case, $T=0$ only), the phase coexistence may be obtained simply by plotting $P^i \times \mu_B^i$, $i = Q, H$, and looking for the intersection of both lines (see Fig.~\ref{Fig:Intersection}). The absence of intersections imply that there are no phase transitions in the range shown (see Fig.~\ref{Fig:NoIntersection}).

We determine the value of chemical potential $\mu_B^i$ for which the
phase transition takes place for all combinations of the parameter
sets from Tables~\ref{Tab:Parametros_NJL}  and ~\ref{Tab:Parametros_eNJL}. Furthermore, we restrict our treatment of the hadron phase to symmetric matter due to the fact that in our treatment of the quark phase the proportion of $u$ and $d$ quarks is always 50\% of each particle. This reflects the fact that both particles are assumed to have the same bare mass and the same chemical potential.

The results so obtained are displayed in
Table~\ref{Tab:Transition_chemical_pot}. In particular we may note
that no combinations involving the BuballaR-2 set with 
$G_V \neq 0$ give rise to a phase transition.

\section{Metastable stars}

The equations of state obtained in the previous sections cannot be
directly used to describe stellar matter because electric charge
neutrality and $\beta$-equilibrium are not taken
into account. To enforce these two conditions, leptons must be
introduced in the system by adding them in the lagrangian density as a
free gas:

\begin{equation}
\mathscr{L}=\overline{\psi}_l[\gamma_\mu(i\partial^\mu -m_l]\psi_l,
\end{equation}
where $l$ refers to the electrons and muons, whose masses are
respectively 0.511 MeV and 105.66 MeV.
The following constraints on chemical
potential and number density have to be imposed:
\begin{eqnarray}
\mu_n=\mu_p +\mu_e  \qquad \mu_e=\mu_{\mu},\\
\rho_p =\rho_e + \rho_{\mu},
\end{eqnarray}
for neutron stars and
\begin{eqnarray}
\mu_s=\mu_d=\mu_u+\mu_e, \qquad \mu_e=\mu_{\mu}, \\
\rho_e+\rho_{\mu}=\frac{1}{3}(2\rho_u-\rho_d-\rho_s),
\end{eqnarray}
for quark stars.

For the lepton densities we have
\begin{equation}
\rho_l=3 \int_0^{k_{Fl}}\frac{d^3p}{(2\pi)^3},
\end{equation}
where $k_{Fl}=\sqrt{\mu_l^2-m_l^2}$.
By adding leptons in the system,
the pressure and energy density increase by $\varepsilon_l$ and $P_l$ given by
\begin{eqnarray}
\varepsilon_l&=&\frac{1}{\pi^2}\sum_m\int_0^{k_{Fl}} dp\sqrt{p^2+m_l^2},\\
P_l&=&\frac{1}{3\pi^2}\sum_l \int_0^{k_{Fl}} \frac{p^4dp}{\sqrt{p^2+m_l^2}}.
\end{eqnarray}
Now we can turn our attention to construct a sequence of compact stars for each
equation of state obtained from the models described in the sections,
(\ref{NJLSU3}) and (\ref{NJLHM}) with $\beta-$equilibrium and electric charge neutrality.
The sequence of compact stars are obtained by using the equation of state, $\varepsilon=\varepsilon(P)$,
as input to the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equations given by
\begin{eqnarray}
\frac{dP}{dr}&=&-\frac{(\varepsilon+P)(M(r)+4\pi r^3P)}{r(r-2M(r))},\\
\frac{dM}{dr}&=&4\pi r^2\varepsilon,\\
\frac{dM_B}{dr}&=&\frac{4\pi r^2\rho_B}{1-2M(r)/r},
\end{eqnarray}
where $r$ is a radial coordinate of the compact star, $P$ and $\varepsilon$ are the
pressure and energy density, $M(r)$ and $M_B(r)$ are the gravitational mass and barionic
mass enclosed in a sphere of radius r and $\rho_B$ is the barionic
density. To solve the TOV
equations we need to impose boundary conditions given by $P(R)=0$ and $P(0)=P_c$,
where $R$ is the star radius and $P_c$ is the central pressure. 
Thus, $M(R)$ and $M_B(R)$ are the total gravitational mass and total barionic
mass of the compact star. 

A compact star consisting only of hadrons (NS),  with no fraction of 
deconfined quark matter, and having a central pressure $P_c$ larger than the transition
pressure $P_0$ for the formation of quark phase matter is metastable 
\cite{2002NuPhS.113..268B, 2003ApJ...586.1250B, 2004ApJ...614..314B} to the
conversion to a quark star (QS). The conversion of a metastable hadron star to a
quark star is a process that releases a huge amount of energy ($\sim
10^{53}$ erg),  which could be the energy source of $\gamma$-ray bursts
and can be estimated from
\begin{equation}
 \Delta E=\left ( M_{NS}-M_{QS} \right ) \times 17.88 \times 10^{53}
 {\rm erg} ,
\label{released}
\end{equation}
where $M_{IS}$ stands for the mass of the $I=N,Q$ star in $M_\odot$
units. In Fig.~\ref{masses} we show typical plots of the the
gravitacional versus the baryonic masses of neutron and quark stars. 
In Fig. ~\ref{energy} we show how the released energy, calculated from
eq.(\ref{released}), varies with the baryonic mass. 
In Table \ref{table:ns-qs} we show some values of the
released energy in the possible conversion process of a metastable
hadronic star  to a quark star. We have assumed constant baryonic mass
in the conversion process. The strenght of the vector interaction in
the lagrangian density of the quark star was chosen as $x=0.7,0.8, 0.9$
so that massive stars can be attained \cite{njlv}.

\section{Conclusions}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%



We have checked  that not all parameterization combinations produce a
system in which a phase-transition is favored. 
Another manifestation of the dependence of the results on the choice
of parameters is the range of chemical potentials for which the
transition takes place: it spans from 1244~MeV to 1744~MeV, a 40\%
difference in relation to the lowest value.  This indicates that the
QCD phase-diagram is parameter dependent.

As a next step on this analysis, we expand our results to include
finite temperature in the system and obtain the binodal sections.
