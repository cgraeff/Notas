	abstract ={The quark–hadron phase transition at finite temperature and baryon chemical potential is investigated in an extended Nambu–Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model with scalar–vector eight-point interaction by comparing the pressure of symmetric nuclear matter with that of the quark matter. As a result, the extended NJL phase diagram is obtained in the temperature–baryon chemical potential plane and the effects of the scalar–vector coupling constant $G_{sv}^q$ on the chiral phase transition are summarized. In our investigation, the quark–hadron phase transition occurs after the chiral phase transition in the nuclear matter. It is shown that a quarkyonic-like phase, in which the chiral symmetry is restored but the elementary excitation modes are nucleonic, appears just before deconfinement in this model.},

By comparing the pressure of the symmetric nuclear matter with that of the quark matter, the realized phase at given baryon density is determined. As a result, the first order quark-hadron phase transition is derived where the deconfinement transition occurs after the chiral symmetry restoration in this model.},
